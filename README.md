# [Project 1: Customer Trends Analysis]()

This is a project I did to showcase my skills in Data Visualization in powerbi, as well as data cleansing and extraction.
Data was taken from Kaggle.com
The dataset offers a comprehensive view of consumer shopping trends, aiming to uncover patterns and behaviors in retail purchasing. It contains detailed transactional data across various product categories, customer demographics, and purchase channels. Key features may include:

Transaction Details: Purchase date, transaction value, product category, and payment method. Customer Information: Age group, gender, location, and loyalty status.
Shopping Behavior: Frequency of purchases, average spend per transaction, and seasonal trends.
