# [Project 1: Customer Trends Analysis]()

This is a project I did to showcase my skills in Data Visualization in powerbi, as well as data cleansing and extraction.
Data was taken from Kaggle.com
The dataset offers a comprehensive view of consumer shopping trends, aiming to uncover patterns and behaviors in retail purchasing. It contains detailed transactional data across various product categories, customer demographics, and purchase channels. Key features may include:

Transaction Details: Purchase date, transaction value, product category, and payment method. Customer Information: Age group, gender, location, and loyalty status.
Shopping Behavior: Frequency of purchases, average spend per transaction, and seasonal trends.

# [Project 2: Manufacturing Downtime]()

This project was developed to do data wrangling (cleansing, validation and enriching) as well as visualization.
Data was taken from Maven Analytics.
Productivity and downtime data for a soda bottling production line, including information on the operator, product, start & end times, and dowtime factors for each batch.
Recommended Analysis
What's the current line efficiency? (total time / min time)
Are any operators underperforming?
What are the leading factors for downtime?
Do any operators struggle with particular types of operator error?
